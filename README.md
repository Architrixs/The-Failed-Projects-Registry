# The Failed Projects Registry

A community-maintained archive of failed ideas, abandoned startups, unfinished side projects, and experiments that didn’t work. The purpose is not humiliation, but learning, transparency, inspiration, and the normalization of failure in creative and technical culture.

## Why it exists

Every failed project is a dataset of what didn't work. By sharing these stories, we can learn from each other's mistakes and experiences, and perhaps inspire new attempts at old ideas. This registry aims to be a valuable resource for entrepreneurs, developers, and makers, fostering a culture where failure is seen as a natural part of the creative process.

## Future Enhancements

The Failed Projects Registry is a living project, and we have many ideas for how to make it even better. Some of the features we are considering for the future include:

*   **A Badge System:** To recognize contributions and highlight interesting patterns in the data.
*   **Advanced Search and Filtering:** More ways to explore and visualize the data.
*   **API Access:** A public API to allow others to build on top of this data.

We welcome your ideas and contributions! If you have a feature you'd like to see, please open an issue to discuss it.
