# Contributing to The Failed Projects Registry

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. Your contributions help make this a valuable resource for the community.

We welcome a variety of contributions, including:

-   Submitting new entries for failed projects.
-   Adding new attempts to existing entries.
-   Improving the visual front-end on GitHub Pages.
-   Suggesting improvements to the project's structure, schema, or contribution process.

## How to Submit a New Entry

There are two ways to submit a new entry to the registry:

### Option 1: Submitting via GitHub Issues (Recommended for beginners)

This is the easiest way to contribute if you are not familiar with Git or JSON.

1.  Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/your-username/The-Failed-Projects-Registry/issues) of this repository.
2.  Click on the "New issue" button.
3.  Choose the "New Entry" template.
4.  Fill out the required fields in the issue form. Please be as detailed as possible.
5.  Submit the issue. A maintainer will then review your submission and, if it's a good fit, add it to the `registry.json` file.

### Option 2: Submitting via Pull Request

If you are comfortable with Git and editing JSON files, you can submit a pull request directly.

1.  Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  Open the `data/registry.json` file.
4.  Add a new JSON object for your entry at the end of the array. Please ensure your entry adheres to the project's schema (see `data/schema.json` for details).
5.  Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b add-my-failed-project`).
6.  Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message (e.g., `feat: add new entry for 'My Failed Project'`).
7.  Push your changes to your forked repository.
8.  Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.

## Examples of Acceptable Entries

To maintain a high-quality and respectful archive, we ask that your submissions adhere to the following guidelines:

-   **Be honest and reflective:** The goal is to learn from failure, so please be open about what went wrong and why.
-   **Focus on the project, not people:** Avoid personal attacks or blaming individuals. The focus should be on the idea, the execution, and the lessons learned.
-   **Provide context:** Help others understand the project by providing as much detail as possible, including links to demos, repositories, or post-mortems if available.

### Unacceptable Entries

We will not accept entries that:

-   Contain personal attacks, harassment, or hate speech.
-   Are primarily for self-promotion or marketing.
-   Lack sufficient detail or context to be useful to others.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing!
