            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>The Failed Projects Registry is a community-maintained archive of failed ideas, abandoned startups, unfinished side projects, and experiments that didn't work out. The purpose is not to celebrate failure for its own sake, but to learn from it. We believe that transparency, inspiration, and the normalization of failure are essential for a healthy creative and technical culture.</p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We operate on a few core principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Failure is data.</strong> Every attempt, successful or not, generates valuable information. By collecting and sharing this data, we can uncover patterns and insights that help others avoid the same pitfalls.</li>
                <li><strong>Ideas are resilient.</strong> A "failed" idea might just be ahead of its time, in the wrong market, or missing a key piece of the puzzle. This registry is a testament to the fact that ideas aren't dead—many are just waiting for their moment.</li>
                <li><strong>Every entry should make you smarter.</strong> The goal of each submission is to leave the reader with a new perspective, a lesson learned, or a deeper understanding of a particular problem space.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
